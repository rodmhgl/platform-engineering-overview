# Defining a Minimum Viable Platform

## What is an MVP?

A **Minimum Viable Platform (MVP)** is a crucial aspect of modern platform engineering, drawing parallels from the idea of a Minimum Viable Product.

## Key Characteristics

- **Foundational version** of an Internal Developer Platform (IDP)
- **Rapidly showcases value** and supports future scalability
- **Does not require** extensive initial development
- **Simple yet functional** version that addresses basic needs
- Provides **tangible benefits** to stakeholders

## Purpose

The MVP serves as a core tenet of the "platform as a product" philosophy, laying the groundwork for **iterative development based on user feedback**.

## Important Understanding

An MVP is **not the final, fully featured platform**—it's a focused starting point that:

- Justifies further investment and commitment
- Demonstrates value quickly
- Allows for course correction before significant resources are invested
