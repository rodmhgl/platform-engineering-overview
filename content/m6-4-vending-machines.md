# Vending Machines

## The Analogy

The **vending machine** serves as a mental model for golden paths within an organization's platform.

## How It Works

### Infrastructure Engineer

Puts the "boxes" or underlying infrastructure components into the vending machine.

### Platform Engineer

Adds the "labels" and sets the "prices," defining how resources can be requested and consumed.

### Developer

**Self-serves** and obtains infrastructure in a uniform way.

## Benefits

- **Reusable components** that developers can select and use
- Products range from simple (DNS) to complex (Kafka topics, databases with replicas)
- **Reduces bottlenecks** and accelerates development
- **Takes weight off** developers, operations, and infrastructure teams
- Provides **clear and consumable interface** to underlying infrastructure

## Conceptualizing Your Platform

Think of your platform as a vending machine:

- What "products" are available?
- How do developers "purchase" them?
- What standardization do you need?
