# Designing Golden Paths

## Process

### 1. Identify Key Pain Points

Use **Value Stream Mapping (VSM)** to visualize:

- Steps in developer workflows
- Lead times and process times
- Completion rates
- Areas of friction

### 2. Map Current State

Understand:

- Sequence of actions
- Individuals and teams involved
- Interaction points within processes
- Baseline for improvement

### 3. Define Target State

Consider needs of all personas:

- Developers
- Operations teams
- Security teams

Design for the **ideal usability point** for each persona.

## Key Design Principles

- **Minimize cognitive load**: Abstract away complexity
- **Nothing can go wrong**: Built-in standardization and automation
- **Allow for flexibility**: Developers can go off-path when needed
- **Discovery mechanism**: IDP reveals needed capabilities

## Prioritization

Focus on tasks that:

- Are performed most frequently
- Consume significant time
- Have highest potential impact
