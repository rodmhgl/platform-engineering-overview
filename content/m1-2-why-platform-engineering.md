# Why Platform Engineering Has Emerged

## Industry Evolution

Platform engineering has emerged as a response to the increasing complexity of cloud-native development and the cognitive load placed on developers.

## Key Drivers

- **Complexity of cloud-native**: Modern applications require managing many components
- **Cognitive overload**: Developers struggle with too many tools and decisions
- **Need for standardization**: Organizations need consistent, scalable approaches
- **Self-service demand**: Teams want independence without ticket-based ops

## Impact on the Industry

- Reduced time-to-market for new features
- Improved developer satisfaction and retention
- Better security and compliance through automation
- More consistent infrastructure management
