# What is Infrastructure Platform Engineering

## Definition

Infrastructure Platform Engineering (IPE) is the discipline of building **internal infrastructure products** that present infrastructure to users in an easily consumable way—like portals offering infrastructure as a service.

## Scope

IPE can relate to:

- Compute
- Networking
- Databases
- Message brokers
- Anything infrastructure-related that workloads depend on

## Core Principles

### Productizing Infrastructure

Treating infrastructure as a product that needs careful design, development, maintenance, and improvement based on user feedback.

### Standardization

Ensuring consistent provisioning, management, and configuration across environments to reduce configuration drift and enable better security and compliance.

### Automation

Automating repetitive and error-prone infrastructure tasks including provisioning, configuration, deployment, and scaling.

### Self-Service

Providing developer self-service tools that eliminate need for manual intervention from I&O teams, reducing wait times.

## Pareto Efficiency

Following this principle, IPE improves the situation for developers and the overall engineering organization by building a **unified abstraction layer** that enables I&O teams to work at eye level with hyperscalers' self-service offerings.
