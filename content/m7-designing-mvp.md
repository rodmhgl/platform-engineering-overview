# Designing and Building Your Own MVP

## Key Principles

When building an MVP, follow these four principles:

### 1. Representative

Your MVP should include **basic resources and components that are common across your organization's technical landscape**—familiar to majority of engineering teams.

**Think**: Common database type, basic CI/CD, application structure (FE/BE/Data), basic ingress and DNS

### 2. Repeatable

The basic skeleton created in the MVP process should be **usable as a "quick start"** for other applications and teams.

- MVP is the foundation for full-scale platform
- Process should be well-documented from day one

### 3. Iterative

MVPs are focused on the future—the **context of creating this version is with growth and iteration in mind**.

- Remember that commitment is required to scale
- Start small, but with the future on the horizon

### 4. Innovative

The teams involved in testing the MVP are **pioneers** and should:

- Drive new ideas forward
- Provide inspiration for contributors
- Learn new things and engage with new technologies

## Implementation Guidance

### Start with Back-end First

Establish foundational logic before adding front-end portal. This aligns with established architecture patterns.

### Everything is Code

Vital for maintaining transparency, increasing reliability, and simplifying maintenance.

### Show Value Within Weeks

Goal is to demonstrate tangible benefits quickly and generate stakeholder buy-in.

### Define Success Metrics

Important to define metrics that can demonstrate value quickly, even if comprehensive DORA metrics aren't available yet.

## Ultimate Goal

The MVP is about demonstrating value and **securing buy-in for continued development**. It's a stepping stone, not the final destination.
