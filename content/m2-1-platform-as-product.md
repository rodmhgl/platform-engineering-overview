# Platform as a Product

## Product Mindset

Treating your Internal Developer Platform as a product means:

- **Understanding your users**: Developers are your customers
- **Iterating based on feedback**: Continuous improvement
- **Measuring success**: Adoption rates, developer satisfaction
- **Marketing internally**: Promoting platform capabilities

## Key Principles

1. **User-centric design**: Build what developers actually need
2. **Clear value proposition**: Articulate the platform's benefits
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive, accessible docs
4. **Support model**: How will users get help?
5. **Roadmap transparency**: Share plans with stakeholders
