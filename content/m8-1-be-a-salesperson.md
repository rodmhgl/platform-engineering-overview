# Why You Need to Be a Salesperson

## The Reality

When building an MVP, **you need to be a salesperson** because simply building a functional platform is not enough to guarantee its success.

## Who You Need to Sell To

You must sell the value of the MVP to a variety of stakeholders:

- **Application developers** (your customers)
- **Infrastructure and operations teams**
- **Executives**
- **Security teams**
- **Architects**

Each group has **different needs and potential veto power**.

## What Effective Selling Requires

### Understand Specific Problems and Pain Points

- Each stakeholder group faces different challenges
- Clearly articulate how the MVP solves their issues

### Demonstrate Return on Investment

- Especially important when seeking long-term funding from executives
- Prove the platform's value with metrics

### Drive Adoption

- Effective selling is crucial for adoption
- Ensures MVP progresses beyond initial stage
- Helps platform become valuable and widely used

## The Stakes

Without effective internal selling:

- Platform may fail to gain traction
- Stakeholders may not see the value
- Funding may not continue
- Platform becomes shelfware
