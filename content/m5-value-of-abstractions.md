# Value of Abstractions

## Definition

An abstraction provides a **higher-level vocabulary** that shields the user from underlying complexity.

## Why Abstractions Matter

- **Manage complexity**: Hide infrastructure details
- **Streamlined experience**: Focus on application development
- **Reduce cognitive load**: Fewer decisions to make

## Caution: Abstractions vs Illusions

It's important to distinguish between:

- **Helpful abstractions**: Genuinely simplify while maintaining functionality
- **Illusions**: Mislead or oversimplify critical aspects

## Two Categories

1. **Frontend abstractions**: Focus on user ergonomics and design
2. **Backend abstractions**: Handle automation and lifecycle management

## Understanding Developer Needs

Before building abstractions:

- Consider needs and perspectives of developers
- Use value stream mapping to identify pain points
- Build what nobody wants is a waste of resources

## Avoiding TicketOps

A key principle is avoiding the anti-pattern of "TicketOps" by ensuring the platform can **supply missing details** and facilitate self-service through **full automation**.
