# Golden Paths vs Golden Cages

## Golden Path Characteristics

- **Preconfigured, paved road** for common tasks
- **End-to-end workflow** that reduces cognitive load
- **Safe and compliant** by design
- **Allows flexibility**: Developers CAN go off-path
- **Incentivizes staying on path** through ease of use

## Golden Cage Anti-Pattern

A **golden cage** arises when developers are **forced to follow non-ideal patterns** with little to no flexibility.

### Warning Signs

- Developers feel **trapped and frustrated**
- Low platform adoption
- Building "tall guardrails" that prevent deviation
- Rigid patterns that don't optimize actual development

## Building High-Speed Highways, Not Cages

The goal is to build a **high-speed highway** that:

- Enhances developer velocity
- Offers choice in interfaces (UI, CLI, API, code-based)
- Maintains tight feedback loop with developers
- Acts as a discovery mechanism for new needs

## The Netflix Cautionary Tale

Netflix's platform journey highlights how rigid approaches can fail. Maintain flexibility while providing value.

## Prevention Strategies

1. Maintain **tight feedback loop** with developers
2. Offer **choice in platform interfaces**
3. Use IDP as **discovery mechanism**
4. Identify when off-path requests signal need for new golden path
