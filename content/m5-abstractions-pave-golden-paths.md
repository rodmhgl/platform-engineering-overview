# How Abstractions Pave Golden Paths

## The Connection

Abstractions are **fundamental to creating and maintaining effective golden paths** by:

- Simplifying steps
- Reducing cognitive load on developers
- Hiding underlying complexities

## How It Works

### Frontend Abstractions

A developer portal or CLI provides a **streamlined way** to:

- Request a new database
- Deploy an application
- Configure services

### Backend Abstractions

Behind the scenes, backend abstractions:

- Provision infrastructure
- Configure security
- Set up monitoring

All through **automation and standardization**.

## The Result

Well-designed abstractions act as the **building blocks of a smooth and efficient golden path**, allowing developers to:

- Focus on core tasks
- Let the platform handle undifferentiated heavy lifting
- Operate safely and compliantly

## Design Considerations

Without abstractions, developers would need to:

- Understand granular details of each component
- Deal with increased complexity
- Navigate potential errors
- Experience slower workflows
