# How to Communicate to Developers

## Key Understanding

Developers are your **internal customers**. Your communication should center around:

- **Their pain points**
- **What matters to them most**

## What Developers Care About

- **Self-service capabilities**
- **Reducing cognitive load**
- **Faster resource provisioning**
- **Greater autonomy**
- **Less waiting for other teams**

## Communication Strategies

### Establish Tight Feedback Loop

- Understand their needs continuously
- Ensure you're building something they value and will adopt

### Avoid Enforcement Language

- Don't focus on enforcement or restrictions
- Frame around **benefits they care about**

### Highlight Key Value Propositions

- "Provision resources faster"
- "Greater autonomy with less waiting"
- "Focus on code, not infrastructure"

### Provide Clear Documentation

- Internal documentation and training workshops
- Help developers understand and effectively utilize the platform

### Show 10x Improvement

Demonstrate how the MVP can make their lives **significantly better**:

- Faster workflows
- Reduced reliance on manual processes
- Real examples of improvement

## The Goal

Gain developer buy-in by showing the platform **makes their lives easier**, not harder.
