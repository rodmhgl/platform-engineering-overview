# Why Infrastructure Platform Engineering?

## The Need

Infrastructure platform engineering has emerged as critical because **you can't just think about DevEx; you also need to tackle infrastructure**.

Gartner has recognized this significance, mentioning IPE in seven different hype cycles in 2024.

## Key Benefits

### Self-Service Layers

Create self-service capabilities that empower developers to deploy and manage infrastructure independently.

### Reducing Bottlenecks

Accelerate delivery by eliminating wait times for infrastructure provisioning.

### Governance and Compliance

Maintain security and compliance through standardized, automated processes.

### Vending Machine Model

By "productizing infrastructure" and offering it through a vending machine model, IPE enables I&O teams to deliver their "products" in a standardized way.

## Business Impact

- **Improved operational efficiency**
- **Reduced ticket ops**
- **Compete effectively** with major cloud providers' self-service offerings
- **Robust platform** underpinning successful software delivery
- **Organizational agility**
