# How to Communicate with Security Teams

## Primary Concerns

Security teams focus on:

- **Security**
- **Compliance**
- **Risk reduction**

## Communication Strategies

### Security by Design

Frame your communication to highlight how the MVP **proactively incorporates security measures from the outset**, rather than as an afterthought.

### Guardrails and Policies by Default

Emphasize how the platform will **enforce guardrails and policies by default**, potentially through secure golden paths for developers.

### Automated Security Checks

Discuss the potential for **automating security checks**, alleviating the burden of time-consuming manual processes they currently face.

### Increased Visibility

Highlight how the platform can provide **increased visibility** into deployments and resource usage, enabling compliance and adherence to corporate policies.

### Lower Risk of Breaches

Articulate how the MVP aims to **lower the risk of security breaches** and associated penalties.

## Critical Success Factor

### Involve Security Early

It's crucial to involve security teams **early in the MVP development process** to:

- Gather their requirements
- Ensure their buy-in
- Get approval for production (often critical for platform success)

## The Pitch

By demonstrating how the MVP can **embed security into the development lifecycle** and reduce their manual workload, you can effectively communicate its value to security stakeholders.
