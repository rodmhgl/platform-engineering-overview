# The Impact of Golden Paths

## Focus on Day Two Operations

Platform engineering should focus on alleviating **daily operational burdens**. "Day two operations" provide the most immediate and substantial value.

## Impact by Task Frequency

| Task | Frequency | Dev Time | Ops Time |
|------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Add/update app configs | 5% | 1h | 1h |
| Add services and dependencies | 1% | 16h | 8h |
| Add/update resources | 0.38% | 8h | 24h |
| Refactor & document architecture | 0.28% | 40h | 8h |
| Waiting due to blocked environment | 0.5% | 15h | 0h |
| Spinning up environment | 0.33% | 24h | 24h |

## Key Impacts

### Reduction in Cognitive Load

Preconfigured paths minimize mental effort, allowing focus on writing code and delivering value.

### Automation of Manual Tasks

Golden paths automate repetitive operational steps, freeing time for strategic work.

### Reduced Waiting Time

Streamlined workflows eliminate need for "ticket ops" for common tasks.

### Enabled Developer Self-Service

Developers can provision resources, deploy applications, and manage configurations independently.

### Improved Security and Compliance

Security and governance enforced automatically through golden path design.

### Better Onboarding

New developers can quickly become productive using established patterns.

### Increased Standardization

Consistent approaches across teams and projects.
