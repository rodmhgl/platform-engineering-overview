# Follow the MVP Framework

## Overview

The MVP framework is a **predictable program** designed to help you build a Minimum Viable Platform effectively.

## Structure

The framework is organized into:

The aim is to complete the MVP within a **maximum of eight weeks**.

## The Four Phases

### Phase 1: Discovery

| Security | Understand security posture |

### Phase 2: Integration

| Tech | Integrate platform tooling |
| Business | Develop Business Case |
| Security | Gather requirements |

### Phase 3: Deployment

| Track | Activities |
|-------|------------|
| Tech | Onboard first app |
| Business | Involve finance team |
| Security | Engage with security team |

### Phase 4: Adoption

| Track | Activities |

| Business | Measure MVP - build ROI |
| Security | Green light for production |

## Key Principles Throughout

### Representative

Include basic resources and components common across your organization.

### Repeatable

Create a "quick start" or skeleton that demonstrates onboarding process. Document well from day one.

### Iterative

While having long-term vision, MVP should be a basic starting point that will evolve and scale.

### Innovative

Treat initial teams using MVP as pioneers. Encourage learning and experimentation.

### Do Not Reinvent the Wheel

Leverage existing technologies and well-established architecture patterns where possible.
