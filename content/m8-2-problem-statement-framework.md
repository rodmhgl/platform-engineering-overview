# Problem Statement Framework for Effective Communication

## Purpose

To effectively communicate with customers and stakeholders during the MVP and beyond, you must **understand their individual "languages"**.

This involves identifying:

- **Pain points**
- **Problems**
- **What truly matters** to each specific persona

## The Framework Structure

The problem statement framework is typically structured as a table with columns representing:

### Persona

The specific group of stakeholders (App developers, Execs, Security, I&O, Architects)

### Problem Statement

A concise description of the overarching problem faced.

*Example for App developers*: "You build it, you run it causes high cognitive load on devs"

### Problem Question

A question that probes deeper into the root cause.

*Example*: "Why is 'You build it, you run it' causing cognitive overload for developers?"

### Symptoms

Observable signs of the problem (waiting times, context switching, manual processes)

### Impact on Persona

How the problem affects this specific group

### Impact on Business

How the problem affects the organization as a whole

### How Platform Solves

Clear articulation of how your platform addresses these specific pain points

### Proof Points and Metrics

Evidence and data that demonstrate the value of your solution

## Outcome

By using this framework, you can **tailor your language and value proposition** to resonate with each persona, increasing likelihood of buy-in and adoption.
