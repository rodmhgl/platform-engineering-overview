# How to Identify Golden Paths

## Value Stream Mapping (VSM)

VSM is a highly recommended technique to:

- **Visualize end-to-end** delivery of value to customers
- Map developer workflows to identify pain points
- Measure key metrics

## Key Metrics

- **Lead time**: How long a step takes to start
- **Process time**: How long a step takes to complete
- **Percentage complete and accurate**: How often done right first time

## Identifying Waste

Map workflows to identify:

- Waiting times
- Manual touchpoints and handoffs
- Excessive context switching
- Non-value-adding operational steps

## From Current to Target State

### Current State Analysis

Break broad processes into **granular day-to-day tasks** to identify specific pain points (e.g., "manual testing" → "slow feedback cycles").

### Target State Definition

Envision streamlined, automated processes that:

- Minimize cognitive load
- Ensure safe and compliant operation
- Consider all personas (developers, ops, security)

## Prioritization Criteria

Focus on golden paths with:

1. **High frequency**: Tasks performed daily
2. **High impact**: Significant time consumption
3. **High pain**: Major developer frustration

## Remember

A true golden path offers **helpful, efficient routes** while allowing flexibility. A golden cage forces developers into rigid patterns.
