# Why Start with an MVP

## Avoiding the "Death Spiral"

One of the most significant reasons is to **avoid the "death spiral of platform engineering"**:

1. Teams get bogged down in lengthy planning phases
2. Fail to execute and demonstrate early value
3. Struggle to gain stakeholder buy-in
4. Cannot generate adoption
5. Lack of funding leads to eventual failure

The MVP counteracts this by **quickly demonstrating value to stakeholders**.

## Key Benefits

### Show Value Within Weeks, Not Months or Years

- Rapid demonstration of tangible benefits
- Essential for generating stakeholder buy-in
- Illustrates what the platform offers and why it matters

### Secure Long-term Funding

- Proving value early helps establish clear path forward
- Sets the stage and plan for wider adoption
- Showcases functional, albeit basic, platform version

### Counter Over-planning and Over-engineering

- Instead of building comprehensive platform from outset
- Focus on foundational version addressing core needs
- Allows for **iterative development** based on feedback

### Address Critical Use Cases First

- Solve immediate day-to-day experience problems
- Focus on pain points developers and operations teams face
- More likely to gain traction and demonstrate worth

### Start with Back-end First

- Establish foundational logic before front-end portal
- Similar to building a house—start with foundation
- Avoids putting UI on top of unaddressed infrastructure challenges

### Learn What Works and What Doesn't

- Test on smaller scale before significant investment
- Allow for course correction
- Makes it easier to pivot based on real-world feedback
