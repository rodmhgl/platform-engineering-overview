# Differences Between Platform Engineering, DevOps, and SRE

## Overview

While these disciplines share common goals, they have distinct focuses and responsibilities.

## DevOps

- **Focus**: Cultural movement breaking silos between Dev and Ops
- **Goal**: Continuous integration and delivery
- **Approach**: Collaborative practices and automation

## SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)

- **Focus**: Reliability, availability, and incident response
- **Goal**: Maintaining service level objectives (SLOs)
- **Approach**: Engineering solutions to operations problems

## Platform Engineering

- **Focus**: Building internal platforms and toolchains
- **Goal**: Developer self-service and golden paths
- **Approach**: Product mindset for internal tools

## Key Distinction

Platform engineering treats the platform as a product for internal customers (developers), while DevOps is a culture and SRE focuses on reliability engineering.
